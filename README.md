# portfolio

This is my portfolio site. I wanted the site to be entirely composed in straight up HTML/CSS as an exercise in making a nice looking functional site that way. 
It really doesn't have a difficult job, just displaying my work and some bio and contact info.
The loading animation of the navbar is based on an animation for making text scroll onto the screen from the right edge. I noticed that when I applied it to the navabar (which is displayed
as a flex-box element) it did a cool "rubber band" effect. 
Other than that, it's pretty standard stuff. I'd like to add a scrolling effect when navigating up and down the page, but I haven't quite been able to get that to work without resorting 
to JavaScript.
