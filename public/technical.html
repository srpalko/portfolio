                <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in
                    the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception
                    handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December
                    1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12
                    July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's
                    Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his
                    long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. He now shares his leadership as a member
                    of a five-person steering council. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett
                    Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council"
                    to lead the project.</p>
                <p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting
                    garbage collector and support for Unicode.</p>
                <p>Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not
                    completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x
                    version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially)
                    the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
                <p>Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a
                    large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.</p>

                <header>Features and philosophy</header>
                <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured
                    programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and
                    aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many
                    other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.
                </p>
                <p>Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage
                    collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which
                    binds method and variable names during program execution.</p>
                <p>Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,
                    map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The
                    standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed
                    from Haskell and Standard ML.</p>
                <p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which
                    includes aphorisms such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Beautiful id better than Ugly.</li>
                    <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
                    <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
                    <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
                    <li>Readability counts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly
                    extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding
                    programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with
                    a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC,
                    which espoused the opposite approach.</p>
                <p>Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in
                    their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto, Python
                    embraces a "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it" design philosophy.
                    Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that "To
                    describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."</p>
                <p>Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts
                    of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of
                    clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension
                    modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also
                    available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the
                    Python interpreter.</p>
                <p>An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the
                    language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful
                    approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from
                    a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.</p>
                <p>A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings
                    related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well,
                    that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist
                    philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads
                    like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.</p>
                <p>Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often
                    referred to as Pythonistas.</p>

                <p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it
                    often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it
                    does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has
                    fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.</p>
                <p>The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the
                    current program. There are three ways of using import: <code>import module name> [as alias>]</code>
                    or <code>print()</code></p>
                <p>Python has a "string format" operator %. This functions analogous to printf format strings in C, e.g.
                    <code>"spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2)</code> evaluates to <code>"spam=blah eggs=2"</code></p>
                <p>Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. <code>7/3 == 2</code>
                    and <code>-7/3 == -3</code>.</p>

                <p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools
                    suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as
                    MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting
                    to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision
                    decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
                <p>As of November 2019, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python
                    software, contains over 200,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:</p>

                <p>Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting
                    them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and
                    receives results immediately.</p>
                <p>Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion,
                    session state retention and syntax highlighting.</p>
                <p>As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs;
                    SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a
                    browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing

                <p>CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard with
                    several select C99 features.[107] It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode[108]
                    which is then executed by its virtual machine.[109] CPython is distributed with a large standard
                    library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including
                    Windows (Vista and later; supported Windows XP and older, with by now unsupported Python 2.7) and
                    most modern Unix-like systems. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities,[110] in
                    Python 1 and 2 time-frame, even supporting VMS and OS/2, while since support has been dropped for a
                    lot of platforms.</p>

                <p>Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the
                    primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and
                    documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are
                    reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.</p>
                <p>Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The
                    mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues are
                    discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. Development originally took place on
                    a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January
                    2017.</p>
